1. Discuss the similarities and differences between Elevens, Thirteens, and Tens.

All games share the objective of combining pairs of cars that equal either Eleven, Thirteen or Ten.

2. As discussed previously, all of the instance variables are declared in the Board class. But it is the
ElevensBoard class that “knows” the board size, and the ranks, suits, and point values of the
cards in the deck. How do the Board instance variables get initialized with the ElevensBoard
values? What is the exact mechanism?

cards = new Card[BOARD_SIZE];
deck = new Deck(RANKS, SUITS, POINT_VALUES);

3. Now examine the files Board.java, and ElevensBoard.java, found in the Activity8
Starter Code directory. Identify the abstract methods in Board.java. See how these
methods are implemented in ElevensBoard. Do they cover all the differences between Elevens,
Thirteens, and Tens as discussed in question 1? Why or why not?

The isLegal and anotherPlayIsPossible methods are abstract. Yes, these abstract methods cover the differences sufficiently.
